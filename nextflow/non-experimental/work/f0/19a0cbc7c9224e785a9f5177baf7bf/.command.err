AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> test_illum_R1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	4	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000	0.40
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 4). Second best hit was Illumina (count: 0)
