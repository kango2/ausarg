Proceeding with single-core trimming (user-defined)
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.5
single-core operation.
igzip detected. Using igzip for decompressing

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Output will be written into the directory: /g/data/xl04/ka6418/nextflow_testing/pipelinetesting/rawdata/shortread/qc/


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> HIC_R1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	26	AGATCGGAAGAGC	500020	0.01
smallRNA	1	TGGAATTCTCGG	500020	0.00
Nextera	1	CTGTCTCTTATA	500020	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 26). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 1)

Writing report to '/g/data/xl04/ka6418/nextflow_testing/pipelinetesting/rawdata/shortread/qc/HIC_R1.fastq.gz_trimming_report.txt'

SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: HIC_R1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.10
Cutadapt version: 4.5
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
Output file(s) will be GZIP compressed

Cutadapt seems to be fairly up-to-date (version 4.5). Setting -j 1
Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to HIC_R1_trimmed.fq.gz


  >>> Now performing quality (cutoff '-q 20') and adapter trimming in a single pass for the adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' from file HIC_R1.fastq.gz <<<
