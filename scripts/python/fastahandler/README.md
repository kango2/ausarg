# FastaHandler
A collection of Python scripts designed for the efficient management of various FASTA file formats.

## Brief Background
**FastaHandler**, created by Hyungtaek Jung and the team at the [National Centre for Indigenous Genomics](https://ncig.anu.edu.au/) at [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), is a Python script suite for efficient FASTA file management. It boasts 17 work modules to ease input/output processes, covering various aspects of FASTA data analysis including post-processing and format conversion. Optimized for life science datasets, **FastaHandler** is a CLI application tested across different FASTA formats. Users should note that processing large datasets may require substantial computational resources on Linux, HPC or Cloud platforms.
