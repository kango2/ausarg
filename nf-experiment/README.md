# Population variation project

Welcome to our GitLab page dedicated to the tools and scripts powering the genomics projects at the [National Centre for Indigenous Genomics (NCIG)](https://ncig.anu.edu.au/). This repository serves as a hub for all essential tools, workflows, and metadata required to facilitate our genomic research projects.


## Repositories:

- GIAB-PerSample-Metadata:

Description: This repository contains meticulously documented metadata for each sample derived from the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) project. The data is structured in Excel sheets for easy access and modification.

- GIAB_PerSample_Scripts:

Description: Hosts scripts related to the processing of individual samples from the GIAB project, ensuring that each sample is treated with precision.

- Genomics-Metadata:

Description: The repository contains a collection of Python scripts, meticulously crafted to facilitate updates, particularly for enhancing columns in the database. These scripts are essential tools in maintaining and updating our dataset effectively.

- Gomics-Pipelines:

Description: A robust repository encompassing a plethora of genomic pipelines that cover a wide array of analytical operations. From aligning sequences to calling variants, from marking duplicate reads to filtering out undesirable data, from converting data into specific formats like 23andMe to more nuanced operations like liftovers and subsetting; everything essential for genomics data processing finds its place here.

- PopVar_Workflow:

Description: This houses the various genomic pipelines employed at NCIG, harnessing the power of workflow management systems like Nextflow.

- rDNA-Pipelines:

Description: Pipelines specifically designed to analyze ribosomal DNA, providing insights into the structural and functional dynamics of this essential genomic region.
